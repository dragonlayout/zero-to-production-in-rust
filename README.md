## Book

A Newsletter

Requirements:

1. As a blog visitor, I want to subscribe to the newsletter, so that I can receive email
updates when new content is published on the blog.
   
2. As the blog author, I want to send an email to all my subscribers, so that I
can notify then when new content is published.
   
3. As a subscriber, I want to be able to unsubscribe from the newsletter,
so that I can stop receiving email updates from the blog.
   
For a blog visitor, input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.
We will implement the /subscribe POST endpoint.

Strategy:

* choose a web framework and get familiar with it;
* define our testing strategy;
* choose a crate to interact with our database;
* define how we want to manage changes to our database schemes over time(a.k.a migrations);
* actually write some queries;
